# Lesson 2: Assignment | JavaScript Control Structures & Functions
- Remember to take your time and work through each question diligently! Test your code, make sure it works, and try to find ways to improve. Once you are happy and satisfied with your code, upload it to Github, then turn in your Github link at the bottom of the page!

- Don't forget. Make sure this assignment is in it's own repository. Not mixed in with others!

## **Exploring Conditional Statements and Loops**
**Objective:** 
The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with conditional statements and loops in JavaScript and enhance their problem-solving skills using these control structures.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that simulates a simple online shopping experience. The program should allow users to browse products, add them to a cart, and calculate the total cost of their purchase.

***Task 1:*** Implement a conditional statement to check if a user is logged in before allowing them to add items to the cart.

***Task 2:*** Use a loop to display the list of available products to the user and add functionality for users to add products to their cart. You can hard code this out by just creating item variables or for EXTRA CREDIT figure out a way to grab user inputs using prompt(). 

***Task 3:*** Calculate the total cost of the items in the cart and display it to the user.

### Expected Outcomes:

- Upon completion of this assignment, students should be able to understand how to use conditional statements to control program flow based on certain conditions.
- Students should be able to implement loops to iterate through arrays and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
- Students will gain practical experience in solving real-world problems using JavaScript control structures.





### Exploring Functions in JavaScript
- Objective: The aim of this assignment is to deepen students' understanding of functions in JavaScript and their various applications in solving programming problems.

**Problem Statement:** Your task is to develop a JavaScript program that simulates a simple banking system. The program should include functions to perform basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

***Task 1:*** Create a function to handle deposits into a bank account.

***Task 2:*** Implement a function to handle withdrawals from a bank account, ensuring sufficient balance.

***Task 3:*** Develop a function to check the current balance of the account.

### Expected Outcomes:

After completing this assignment, students should demonstrate proficiency in creating and using functions to perform specific tasks.
Students should understand the importance of function modularity and reusability in programming.
This assignment will enable students to apply their knowledge of functions to practical scenarios, such as banking operations, thereby enhancing their problem-solving skills.
